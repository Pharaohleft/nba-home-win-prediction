## 📊 Dataset

We used NBA game data from 2003–2022, including:  
- **Game-level stats:** Points, shooting %, assists, rebounds  
- **Home & away team IDs**  
- **Outcome:** Whether the home team won  

The data was sourced from publicly available datasets (e.g., Kaggle).

## ⚙️ Process

1️⃣ **Data Cleaning & Exploration**  
- Dropped rows with missing values (~0.3% of data).  
- Explored team performance stats and outcome distributions.

2️⃣ **Feature Engineering**  
- Selected key performance features for modeling:  
  - Home & away team points  
  - Shooting % (FG, FT, 3PT)  
  - Assists and rebounds

3️⃣ **Modeling**  
- Baseline model: **Logistic Regression**  
- Achieved high accuracy (~100%) due to strong correlation of features like points scored.

4️⃣ **Insights**  
- Home team points and shooting percentages are strongly predictive of winning.  
- Away team performance is inversely correlated to home team success.

## 🚀 Results

✅ Logistic Regression model achieved ~100% accuracy on the test set.  
✅ This is due to direct relationship between points and winning outcomes in the dataset.

## 📈 Visualizations

- Correlation matrix of features and target  
- Distribution of home/away points  
- Model performance metrics  

(See `notebooks/nba_game_prediction.ipynb` for plots and analysis!)

---

## 🌟 Key Takeaways

- **Correlation insights**: High-scoring home teams are very likely to win, while away scoring decreases home win chances.  
- **Model caveats**: This perfect accuracy reflects clear-cut data — real-world prediction on future games would be harder!
